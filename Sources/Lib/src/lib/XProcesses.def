  It should be stated that Oberon-2 Garbage Collector (GC) 
  to work properly must suspend all threads and scan all
  threads' stacks for Oberon-2 pointers.

  To optimize performance all threads that
  do not execute Oberon-2 code or do not have Oberon-2 pointers
  in local variables may be marked as GC-inaware.
