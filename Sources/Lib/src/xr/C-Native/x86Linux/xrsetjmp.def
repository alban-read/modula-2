(* Snowman 05-Nov-1999:

   In XDS-C, X2C_setjmp and X2C_longjmp are directly mapped onto POSIX
   setjmp and longjmp, which first arguments have type jmpbuf, not
   jmpbuf*. This is most probably due to the fact that these functions
   are likely to be macros. For the generated xrsetjmp.h to be compatible
   with X2C.c, we have to define X2C_jmp_buf not as record, but as
   a one element array of records. Looks stupid but works perfectly.

TYPE
  X2C_jmp_buf = ARRAY [0..0] OF RECORD
    ebx,ecx,edx,esi,edi,ebp,eip,esp: CARDINAL;
    es,ds,cs,fs,gs,ss: SYSTEM.CARD16;
  END;

PROCEDURE X2C_setjmp (point: X2C_jmp_buf) : SYSTEM.int;
PROCEDURE X2C_longjmp(point: X2C_jmp_buf; n: SYSTEM.int);

END xrsetjmp.
