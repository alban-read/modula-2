\chapter{XDS}
\label{XDS}

{\bf XDS} is a family name for development systems featuring
Modula-2 and Oberon-2 programming languages, available for Windows and Linux
on the IBM PC and compatibles. XDS provides an uniform programming environment
for all mentioned platforms and allows to design and implement truly
portable software.

The XDS Modula-2 compiler implements ISO standard of Modula-2.
The ISO standard library set is accessible for both Modula-2 and
Oberon-2.

All XDS implementations share the same platform-independent front-end
for both source languages. The output code can be either native code
for the target platform ({\bf Native XDS}) or text in the ANSI C language
({\bf XDS-C}). ANSI C code generation enables you to cross-complile
your programs for any platform.

XDS includes standard ISO and PIM libraries along with a set of utility
libraries and interfaces to the host operating system API (Win32 or POSIX/X11)
and the ANSI C library (XDS-C only).

Native XDS-x86 produces highly optimized Intel x86 code.
It is available for Windows and Linux. Windows version comes with
an IDE, debugger, prfiles, and other tools.
