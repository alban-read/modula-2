\chapter{Oberon-2 Oakwood libraries}\label{lib:oak}

{\em The Oakwood Guidelines for the Oberon-2 Compiler Developers}
specifies a set of libraries that should be provided with all Oberon
implementations. The current \xds{} release does not contain all these
libraries yet. The following libraries are currently available:
\begin{flushleft}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\bf In        & input from a standard stream   \\
\bf MathR     & mathematical functions for REAL  \\
\bf MathL     & mathematical functions for LONGREAL  \\
\bf MathC     & mathematical functions for COMPLEX  \\
\bf MathLC    & mathematical functions for LONGCOMPLEX  \\
\bf Out       & output to a standard stream    \\
\bf O2Strings & simple manipulations for strings    \\
\end{tabular}
\end{flushleft}
\lindex{MathR}
\lindex{MathL}
\lindex{MathC}
\lindex{MathLC}
\lindex{In}
\lindex{Out}
\lindex{O2Strings}

The {\bf Math} library is renamed to {\bf MathR}, because it
coincides with the POSIX {\tt math} library
interface\ifcomment !!! (See \ref{lib:clib})\fi.
The complex types and, hence, {\bf MathC} and
{\bf MathLC} modules may be not available for other Oberon
implementations.

The {\bf Strings} library is renamed to {\bf O2Strings}, since
it is not compatible with the correspondent ISO library.
