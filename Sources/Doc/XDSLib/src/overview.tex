The following sets of libraries are provided:
\begin{itemize}
\item         ISO standard Modula-2 libraries (Chapter \ref{lib:ISO})
\item         A subset of libraries defined in \cite{PIM} (Chapter \ref{lib:PIM})
\item         Utility libraries (Chapter \ref{lib:util})
\item         A subset of \ot{} Oakwood standard libraries (Chapter \ref{lib:oak})
% !!! \item         Interface to ANSI C libraries (Chapter \ref{lib:clib})
\ifcomment
\item         A subset of Mithril core libraries (Chapter \ref{lib:mi})
\fi

\end{itemize}

{\bf Note:} All these libraries can be used with both \mt{} and \ot{}
compilers. Some libraries are written in \ot{}, others in \mt{}. If a
program consists of both \ot{} and \mt{} modules, two memory
managers are in use. In rare cases it can lead to problems with
memory allocation  or  deallocation.  A special care was taken to
eliminate these problems. % !!! (See \ref{rts:mm}).
