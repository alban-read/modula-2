The following libraries defined in \cite{PIM} are provided:
\begin{flushleft}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\bf InOut     & general-purpose IO operations                   \\
\bf LongInOut & LONGREAL numbers IO operations                  \\
\bf MathLib0  & mathematical functions                          \\
\bf RealInOut & REAL numbers IO operations                      \\
\bf Terminal  & computer's terminal IO operations               \\
\end{tabular}
\end{flushleft}
\lindex{InOut}
\lindex{LongInOut}
\lindex{MathLib0}
\lindex{RealInOut}
\lindex{Terminal}

\noindent
The library {\bf LongInOut} (similar to {\bf RealInOut}) is not
described in \cite{PIM}. All PIM libraries are implemented on
a basis of the ISO library.
Since PIM {\bf Storage} library is not
compatible with the corresponding ISO library, it is omitted.
