\chapter{Remote debugging}
\label{remote}

%$ New in 1.1:

With XD, you may debug programs running on another computer to which you may
connect via network. Table \ref{remote:protocols} contains the list of
supported networks protocols.

\begin{table}[htbp]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}

\bf Code & \bf Protocol & \bf Remote system identified by \\

\tt TCP  & TCP/IP & IP address \\

\section{Preparing for remote debugging}

\ifwinnt
Copy the following files from the {\tt BIN} subdirectory of your XDS installation
to an empty directory on the target system:

\begin{verbatim}
    XD_SRV.EXE  XDS24.DLL     XD_NB09.DLL
                XD_DITLS.DLL  XD_T_TCP.DLL
                XD_NB04.DLL   XD_UTL.DLL
                  
\end{verbatim}
\else\ifosii
\fi
\fi

\section{Starting debug server}

To launch the debug server on the target machine, issue the following command:

\verb'    XD_SRV /R=<protocol code>'

Example:

\verb'    XD_SRV /R=TCP'


\section{Starting XD in remote mode}

To start XD in remote mode, use the {\tt /R} command line switch:

\verb'    XD /R=<protocol code>,<remote system id>'

For instance, if you want XD to connect via TCP/IP to the debug server running
on a machine which IP address is \verb'server.mycompany.com', issue the
following command:

\verb'    XD /R=TCP,server.mycompany.com'
