\section{Warnings from C compiler}

The produced C text should contain no errors,
but various C compilers may produce different kinds of warnings.
The most probable warnings are:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Code has no effect;
\item
Variable (or parameter) is never used;
\item
Function should return a value.
\end{itemize}
Do not pay attention to these warnings.

\section{Ordering of record fields}

Some procedures from the run-time library are implemented
under the assumption that the C compiler will not change the
order of record fields. If your C compiler supports various
ordering of structs please ensure that the appropriate
C compiler option is switched ON.

\section{Name collisions in C text}

In some cases name collisions in generated C text are possible.
If an identifier in your program coincides with an identifier
from some standard header file append it to the {\bf\kwd{}} file.

Some basic C compilers (or linkers) might truncate the names
or external names. Use the {\bf GENIDLEN} equation to generate
indetifiers of required length. See \ref{maptoc:idents}
for further information.
