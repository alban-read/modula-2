			Huffman Channels:
		An ISO Modula-2 I/O Library Sample

To build this sample, type:

    xc =m huf.mod
    xc =m unhuf.mod


This sample illustrates the concept of device modules introduced
in the ISO Modula-2 input/output library. This concept allows
a programmer to provide new device modules in addition to the 
standard ones to extend the library functionality whuile 
preserving the interface.

The sample contains a HuffChan device module, which implements
Huffman encoding and decoding. It provides a procedure which
creates an alias Huffman channel for a given channel. Issuing 
the RawWrite operation on the alias channel will cause the data 
to be encoded and then written to the original channel. 
Similarly, the RawRead operation decodes the data read from
the original channel. 

The correspondent section in the manual is:

ISO Modula-2 Library Reference
    Input/Output
        Interface to Channels for New Device Modules

The decoding routines do not perform any error checking.Also,
mixing read and write operations or operations on the alias 
channel with operations on the original channel is not 
supported. 

The two programs, "huf" and "unhuf", utilize the HuffChan module
facilities. The first program encodes a given file and writes 
it to another file; the second one reverses that operation.
