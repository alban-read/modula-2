                   RegKey - Win32 JNI Sample 


This sample demonstrates usage of XDS Modula-2 for the creation
of Java native methods. It consists of a Java class that 
provides interface to the Windows registry through native
methods, a Modula-2 DLL that implements these methods, and
a simple key editor.

To build the sample, run the BUILD.BAT script.

To run the sample, run the RUN.BAT script.

The sample compiles ok with Native XDS-x86 2.45 and Sun JDK 1.2.2 
javac. It has been tested on Windows NT 4 with Sun JRE 1.2.2.
